# Introduction

- [ ] Abstract of the project
- [ ] Insert even a mention of the papers
 
# K-Means algorithm

- [ ] How it's work (main step and theory)
 
## K-Means: Parallelization

- [ ] Explain why we have divided the kernel in this specified way
 
# Images quantization

- [ ] Explain what does it means 
- [ ] How the quantization could be a sort of cartoonization for the images
 
# Our solution

- [ ] An abstract about our program (what it does)
 
## Used technologies

- [ ] What we will discuss in this section

### CUDA C++

- [ ] Brief information about CUDA C++
 
### OpenCV

- [ ] Brief information about OpenCV

## Implementation

- [ ] `sequential.cpp`
- [ ] `parallel.cu`
- [ ] Put some details about the main block of the code
- [ ] Perhaps insert a section for each kernel where details are explained

### How to execute

- [ ] Firstly we have to insert a table that contains all sys requirements (OS, GPU, CPU, GPU's Driver Version, CUDA Version, OpenCV version)
- [ ] Mention dependencies and show the execution command (for RedJeans, My Ubuntu)

# Problem's analysis

- [ ] Introduce Nsight Compute and Nsight System
- [ ] Mention the used hardware
 
## Nsight compute analysis

- [ ] Discuss the results provided by nsight compute tool
- [ ] How nsight compute analysis has improved the performance
- [ ] Put some graphics and tables

## Nsight system analysis

- [ ] Discuss the results provided by nsight systems tool
- [ ] How nsight systems analysis has improved the performance
- [ ] Put some graphics and tables

## Results

- [ ] Put some tables that compare the performance among different architecture (such as CPU vs GPU | 4060 vs RedJeans)

> In the tables will put all specs of the hardware, even the used OS
 
# Final considerations

- [ ] Discuss how the parrallelizzation has improved the performance
